            /* In this experiment we have 2 static nodes the server and 
             * router and N dynamic worker nodes. The process goes like this:
             * 1) A worker boots up and asks the router for work
             * 2) The router acknowledges the request and in turn asks the server for the next work item
             * 3) The server recieves the request and asks the user to enter a workload (a number)
             * 4) The user enters a number which the server sends back to the router
             * 5) The router forwards the workload (the number) to the first available worker
             * 6) The worker recieves the number and sleeps for that amount of time (in ms)
             * 7) Once the worker completes the work (thread finishes sleeping) we start back at step 1
             * 
             * I found that the workers could boot up before the router and everything goes smoothly from there.
             * However, if any of the static nodes of the network go down we have a problem. Workers will hang
             * waiting for work if the router goes down and the router will hang if the server goes down. Basically
             * your screwed if a node is sitting there waiting for a response from a crashed node. It's kind of
             * like if you were browsing youtube and the youtube server went down and hung your browser. In the end, 
             * if the static nodes die the workers must also be restarted. Maybe the workers can 
             * time out, die, and restart?
             * 
             * This is also got me thinking about message reliability. Assuming the server was reading from a queue
             * rather than receiving input from the user. The message is sent from the server to the router and 
             * the server doesnt care that the message actually gets delivered to the workers or that the
             * work is actually performed. I need to do some more reading about distributed systems and see if 
             * there are any answers about reliability.
